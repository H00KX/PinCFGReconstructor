With the development of more and more advanced techniques to obfuscate Malwarethe community of reverse engineers and CS researchers has to cope with more andmore complex programs who brought the need of more advanced analysis than staticones.To truly understand what such programs do you need to look at them while theyare executing, thus tools that allow to achieve this have become one of the mostpowerful weapons to face new threats.One of the way to do this is through Dynamic Binary Instrumentation. Althoughthis technique is very powerful, it carries with it some trade-offs.A particular tool that let you perform this is Intel PIN and in this thesis we want tounderstand which are the implementation trade-offs linked to the level of granularityand quantity of information we want to achieve using this particular tool.
